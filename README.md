Hello, I'm an entrepreneur who recently fell in love with programming. Currently, I work with the clothing trade in Brazil.

I started my programming studies in August 2022, through a GO language course. After that I developed API studies, including REST API with MySQL database, and some other applications. Despite focusing my studies on the Back-End, I also studied some HTML and CSS to learn how the Front-End communicates with the Back-End.

In November I started the Bootcamp Journey DevOps with AWS - Impulso, with excellent courses on Linux, Docker, Kubernetes and AWS. Great topics that I intend to deepen, I finished in December in the 4th position among 4554 registrations.

I am developing my English communication with studies through a DIO course and mobile apps, I have a good reading level, and I hope to be able to speak better in a few months.

I am interested in working with Software development or as DevOps.
